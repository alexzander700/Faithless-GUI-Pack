# Faithless-GUI-Pack

Simple UI pack that I made for Faithless since Faithless Bedrock didn't have the amazing UI that the normal version has


☐/☑
## Planned:
GUI for every GUI block
* Crafting Table
* Furnace
* Stonecutter
* Grindstone
* Blast Furnace
* Smoker
* Smithing table
* Loom
* Chest
* Double Chest
* Ender chest
* Shulkers
* Chest Boat
* Chest Minecart
* Hopper
* Hopper Minecart
* Horses
* Donkeys
* Mules
* Llamas
* Camels

Boss bars?
* The other pack changes boss bars, but I need to look into it further.
* It *should* be possible, just I've never seen it in bedrock before
